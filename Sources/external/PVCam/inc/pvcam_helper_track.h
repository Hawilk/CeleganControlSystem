Allocate and initialize the context used in the helper library.

After #ph_track_init is called, the #ph_track_link_particles function can be
used by providing the context. When done, the provided context should be passed
to #ph_track_uninit to free the memory.

A new context should be initialized for each sequence acquired to clear the
tracking state.

@param[out] pContext            A location where newly allocated context will be
                                stored.
@param[in]  maxFramesToLink     The maximum number of frames to establish
                                linkage between. For example, using value 2 will
                                link particles only between consecutive frames.
                                Using @a maxFramesToLink of 3 will allow frames
                                to disappear for one frame and become
                                re-established one frame later. The minimum
                                value is 2. Larger values of @a maxFramesToLink
                                will utilize more computational and memory
                                resources and scales as O(n^2).
                                Values larger than 5 are not recommended.
@param[in]  maxDistancePerFrame The maximum number of pixels to allow a linkage
                                between per frame. For example, if an event is
                                identified at location (100,100) in one frame,
                                then a @a maxDistancePerFrame would allow an
                                event at (150,100) on the subsequent frame or an
                                event at (200,100) on a 2nd frame to be linked
                                to that first event, if the value is 50.
                                The value should be higher for faster moving
                                particles, but larger values can also lead to
                                incorrect linkages if the event density is high
                                enough for mismatches to occur. A value of 50
                                pixels is suggested for most applications.
                                This parameter can range from 0 to the full
                                diagonal dimension of the sensor, and is
                                specified in units of pixels.
@param[in]  forceCpuOnly        The library automatically utilizes a
                                CUDA-compatible GPU if one is found in the
                                system, unless the @a forceCpuOnly flag is set.
                                If multiple compatible GPUs are found, the one
                                with the highest compute capability is used.
                                If no compatible GPU is found, the library will
                                only utilize the system's CPU.
@param[in]  maxCentroidsCount   The number of centroids used to setup PVCAM
                                acquisition.
@param[out] pMaxOutputParticles The number of elements that must be provided in
